# My Personal Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find the deployed site at [cporter.netlify.app](https://cporter.netlify.app). This has been a joy to create and I look forward to interating over it to further develop my skills.

## Journey

When first learning to code, I completed a portfolio project for the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design certification. It wasn't anything special, but it was mine and I liked it. It also passed all the tests that were required in order to complete that part of the practical assessment. My [first portfolio](https://codepen.io/agohige_tech/pen/LYYGvgG) now makes me cringe a bit, but it is a great reminder of how far I've come since starting my coding journey.

### Goals

At present, my goal is to help as many veterans transition into tech as possible. The jobless and homeless stats on veterans is atrocious, and anything we can actively do to help bring those numbers down is needed.

To do that I have partnered with [#VetsWhoCode](https://vetswhocode.io) to first learn their program via going through a front-end bootcamp then to give back and mentor veterans. This organization is a 501c(3) non-profit that is ran by veterans for veterans. With their help and support, I will see this goal to fruition.

### Technical Goals

From a technical standpoint, I have a goal to become the 'go-to' Javascript developer amoung my peers (whomever they may be). Once I have established a solid foundation in Javascript, I believe picking up any library/framework will come with more ease. The general knowledge gained from increasing depth of a language will help tremendously across the board as a SWE.

### Blog

This site does have a blog that you can check out. It has some tid bits of info that I have learned from and hope will guide others. I intend to use this space to document things learned so I can reference them again in the future.
